# Web-Design-Xtream-Chaser
Final Project given by Human Computer Interaction in laboratory Class
In this project, I experimented a lot in how much can HTML and CSS go without using any javascript. Besides that, the website that has been made is "responsive website"

NOTE
All pictures are not mine and only use for educational purposes one of the main themes that have taken from the art of Maple Story for its character and background
